# ReWear — Community Clothing Exchange 👕♻️

**ReWear** is a web-based platform designed to promote sustainable fashion by encouraging users to exchange unused clothing through a peer-to-peer swap system or a point-based redemption model. Our goal is to minimize textile waste and create a circular economy around wearable garments.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

ReWear empowers individuals to:

- 🧥 Exchange gently-used clothing directly with others
- 🎯 Redeem points earned from contributions for new items
- 🔁 Recycle fashion instead of discarding it

By building a community-driven system, ReWear inspires conscious consumerism and supports eco-friendly habits.
